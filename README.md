This attempt aims to analyze terrorist attacks in India, utilizing datasets that encompass various demographics and characteristics collected over the years. 

The analysis🛠️💡 focuses on identifying trends within these attacks and correlating them with different demographic factors to uncover patterns among the various data representations. 

What you will see in the notebook:

🧹 Data Cleaning: Started by giving our data a good scrub, ensuring every bit and byte was spotless and ready for analysis.
📊 Data Visualization: Next, turned these clean datasets into vibrant visuals, making complex patterns accessible and understandable at a glance.
🔍 Pattern Discovery: Through this journey, I've been piecing together the puzzle, revealing how, where, and when these attacks occur, and more importantly, the story they tell.
