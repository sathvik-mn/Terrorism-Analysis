This attempt aims to analyze terrorist attacks in India, utilizing datasets that encompass various demographics and characteristics collected over the years. 

The analysis🛠️💡 focuses on identifying trends within these attacks and correlating them with different demographic factors to uncover patterns among the various data representations. 

What you will see in the notebook:

🧹 Data Cleaning: Started by giving our data a good scrub, ensuring every bit and byte was spotless and ready for analysis.
📊 Data Visualization: Next, turned these clean datasets into vibrant visuals, making complex patterns accessible and understandable at a glance.
🔍 Pattern Discovery: Through this journey, I've been piecing together the puzzle, revealing how, where, and when these attacks occur, and more importantly, the story they tell.

You are encouraged to use these datasets for further analysis. Together, we can shed light on the shadows, understand the patterns, and contribute to a safer, more informed world. 🌍✨
